E- set of edges, V- set of vertices
MATCHING: Subset M of E s.t no two edges in M share a vertex
Edge Cover: Subset F of E s.t any vertex v in V is incident to some e in F
Independent Set: Subset S of V s.t no two points are adjacent
Vertex Cover: Subset S of V s.t each edge e in E is incident to at least one vertex in S.

a. (For any graph without isolated vertex)

    |Max Matching| + |min edge cover| = |V|

b. |Max Independent Set| + |Min.vertex cover| = |V|

c. For Bipartite Graph, | Max Matching| = |Min Vertex Cover| (Konig's theorem)
